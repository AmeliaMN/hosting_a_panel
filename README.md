## What is a Panel

A panel discussion is when an organizer asks a number of different speakers or members of a community to all come up on stage 
together and have a moderated discussion. Usually these discussions are centered around a topic, and there is some broader
narrative that the organizer and moderator want to discover or convey. Panels consist of at least:

1. A moderator
2. Two or more guests

A moderator and a single guest is not a panel, it is usually called an interview or a fireside chat or something like that. 
This repository doesn't cover interviewing best practices. I may write that up, but I am really focused on the lessons I have
learned organizing a number of different panels, and what the responsibilities of each participant are.

## Putting Together a Panel

This section contains a rough outline for putting together a panel. We will discuss most of these points in some detail in
following sections. The rough outline (from the point of view of the organizer and moderator) is:

1. Before the event
   1. Deciding you are going to host a panel as part of some event or as a standalone discussion
   2. Coming up with the overall theme of the panel. 
   3. Picking a date and finding a venue. As this is more general 'event planning' stuff, I will not go into it further.
   4. Creating the candidate list of panelists
   5. Reaching out to the panelists and gauging their interest
   6. Getting confirmation from your panelists
   7. Researching your panalists to find out what they're most qualified to speak to
   8. Creating a panel goal and topic statement
   9. Creating a candidate list of questions
   10. Having a pre-call with your panelists (either individually or as a conference call)
   11. Sharing with your panelists your list of candidate questions so they can be prepared
   12. Verifying that your panelists will be able to attend the panel
2. At the event
   1. On the day of the panel, meeting before the panel to check that everyone feels comfortable with their participation
   14. Making sure the panelists have comfortable appropriate places to sit on stage
   15. Making water available to your panelists during the panel
   16. Introducing your panelists and actually hosting and moderating the panel
   17. Moderating the Q&A after the panel (if you chose to have one.)
   18. Thanking your panelists
3. After the event
   1. Reaching out to your panelists a few days later for feedback as to how the panel could have been better
   20. Feeling great that you moderated a well run panel which was really valuable to the audience as well as the panelists
   21. Getting bitten by the bug and planning your next panel

Yes, I understand this is a long list, and I am sure I have missed a few steps, but I think it's important to recognize a few 
things:

1. There is nothing more precious a gift that someones attention. Moderating a panel is the responsibility of the gift of your audiences attention as well as your panelists. It's a privileged position
2. Panels are not an easy organic format. A panel where people bicker with each other, or where there is stunning silence while the moderator scrambles to ask a question is a very bad experience
3. This is a time in life where preparation will definitely show. A well run panel is a thing of beauty, and the audience will know if it was a phoned in effort.

Running a great panel is an amazing responsibility and opportunity. Treat it appropriately.

## Before the Event

By far, this is the part I see inexperienced moderators inadequately address the most often. A great panel doesn't come 
together on the stage. A great panel is the culmination of, on average, 20+ hours of pre-work. If you're unwilling or unable
to commit to roughly that order of magnitude of work, you should not chose to run a panel. It is not acceptable to cut this
part of the process out, it is disrespectful to the audience as well as the panelists. If done well, it will be wildly 
rewarding and the fruits of your efforts will be obvious to all involved.

### Deciding You Are Going to Host a Panel

Why do you want to host a panel? What is it about the format that you feel will likely drive a more compelling narrative than
presentations? Panels are great when you want to have a portfolio of different perspectives on stage simulatneously, and you
feel confident that you can weave a narrative of interplay and give and take. You should decide to host a panel if there is
some subjective questions that you think would be shaped by different experiences, or if there is some controversy in your 
field that you want to surface from the position of multiple experts. At the root of it, you should run a panel when some
topic is big and interesting enough that it is unlikely to receive the best treatment from a single point of view.

### Coming up with the overall theme of the panel
