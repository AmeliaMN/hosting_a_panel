# Eduardo Ari√±o de la Rubia's Guide to Hosting a Panel

## What is a Panel

A panel discussion is when an organizer asks a number of different speakers or members of a community to all come up on stage 
together and have a moderated discussion. Usually these discussions are centered around a topic, and there is some broader
narrative that the organizer and moderator want to discover or convey. Panels consist of at least:

1. A moderator
2. Two or more guests

A moderator and a single guest is not a panel, it is usually called an interview or a fireside chat or something like that. 
This repository doesn't cover interviewing best practices. I may write that up, but I am really focused on the lessons I have
learned organizing a number of different panels, and what the responsibilities of each participant are.

## Putting Together a Panel

This section contains a rough outline for putting together a panel. We will discuss most of these points in some detail in
following sections. The rough outline (from the point of view of the organizer and moderator) is:

1. Before the event
   1. Deciding you are going to host a panel as part of some event or as a standalone discussion
   2. Coming up with the overall theme of the panel. 
   3. Picking a date and finding a venue. As this is more general 'event planning' stuff, I will not go into it further.
   4. Creating the candidate list of panelists
   5. Reaching out to the panelists and gauging their interest
   6. Getting confirmation from your panelists
   7. Researching your panalists to find out what they're most qualified to speak to
   8. Creating a panel goal and topic statement
   9. Creating a candidate list of questions
   10. Having a pre-call with your panelists (either individually or as a conference call)
   11. Sharing with your panelists your list of candidate questions so they can be prepared
   12. Verifying that your panelists will be able to attend the panel
2. At the event
   1. On the day of the panel, meeting before the panel to check that everyone feels comfortable with their participation
   14. Making sure the panelists have comfortable appropriate places to sit on stage
   15. Making water available to your panelists during the panel
   16. Introducing your panelists and actually hosting and moderating the panel
   17. Moderating the Q&A after the panel (if you chose to have one.)
   18. Thanking your panelists
3. After the event
   1. Reaching out to your panelists a few days later for feedback as to how the panel could have been better
   20. Feeling great that you moderated a well run panel which was really valuable to the audience as well as the panelists
   21. Getting bitten by the bug and planning your next panel

Yes, I understand this is a long list, and I am sure I have missed a few steps, but I think it's important to recognize a few 
things:

1. There is nothing more precious a gift that someones attention. Moderating a panel is the responsibility of the gift of your audiences attention as well as your panelists. It's a privileged position
2. Panels are not an easy organic format. A panel where people bicker with each other, or where there is stunning silence while the moderator scrambles to ask a question is a very bad experience
3. This is a time in life where preparation will definitely show. A well run panel is a thing of beauty, and the audience will know if it was a phoned in effort.

Running a great panel is an amazing responsibility and opportunity. Treat it appropriately.

## Before the Event

By far, this is the part I see inexperienced moderators inadequately address the most often. A great panel doesn't come 
together on the stage. A great panel is the culmination of, on average, 20+ hours of pre-work. If you're unwilling or unable
to commit to roughly that order of magnitude of work, you should not chose to run a panel. It is not acceptable to cut this
part of the process out, it is disrespectful to the audience as well as the panelists. If done well, it will be wildly 
rewarding and the fruits of your efforts will be obvious to all involved.

### Deciding You Are Going to Host a Panel

Why do you want to host a panel? What is it about the format that you feel will likely drive a more compelling narrative than
presentations? Panels are great when you want to have a portfolio of different perspectives on stage simulatneously, and you
feel confident that you can weave a narrative of interplay and give and take. You should decide to host a panel if there is
some subjective questions that you think would be shaped by different experiences, or if there is some controversy in your 
field that you want to surface from the position of multiple experts. At the root of it, you should run a panel when some
topic is big and interesting enough that it is unlikely to receive the best treatment from a single point of view.

### Coming up with the overall theme of the panel

Your theme should be broad enough to allow for multiple perspectives and points of view, but not so broad as to be useless.
A very narrow theme can be constraining and leave the panelists mostly repeating each other's points, or discussing fine
but not meaningful differences in position. On the contrary, a very broad theme an lead to a meandering discussion without a 
central thesis. The theme should be interesting, have an element of controversy, and be relevant and actionable to the 
audience.

For example:

* 'Women in Technology' is too broad a theme, that will likely lead to generalized statements and plattitudes
* 'Recruiting and Retaining Women in Software Startups' is probably narrow enough to be interesting, but still allow interesting conversation

Or for example:

* 'Updates in GCC 7.3' is too narrow a theme, that is likely better done as a focused presentation
* 'Advancements and the Future of Compilers' is still quite narrow, but it will allow for some subjective discussion

Those are just two arbitrary examples, and I will add more as I have more time. You want to make sure that it's not a topic
that has already been thoroughly explored. But the core idea is that you want it to be narrow
enough that experts can say deep things, you want it to have some subjectivity so that the conversation can include your 
panelists specific and unique opinion, and most of all you want it to sound interesting.

### Picking a Date and Finding a Venue

My only note here is that you should be picking a date at least 2-3 months out. It is not acceptable to spring a panel request
on someone a week or two in advance unless there's an extenuating circumstance (such as another panelist dropped out.) Since
your panelists are likely experts, they're probably busy. Be respectful of their scheduling and time, and give them plenty
of opportunity to work your panel into their schedule, not just logistically, but intellectually. Your panelists will likely
want to have time to think about the topic and make sure they can say something compelling. They became experts through hard
work and passion, give them time to leverage that hard work and passion towards your panel as well.

### Creating the Candidate List of Panelists

This is very important not to screw up. Your panel should have:

1. Experts
2. Diversity

Experts is pretty self explanitory. They should be able to contribute some non-trivial insight to the overall discussion. 
But that's not the part where moderators and organizers screw up. They screw up on diversity.

So, by diversity I explicitly mean your panel *must* have:

1. Women
2. People of color
3. People of different ages
4. People from different ethnicities
5. People with different experiences

Yes. This likely makes it that your immediately social network is not the right place to draw the panelists. Even the most 
well meaning diversity minded individual likely has a high degree of [Homophily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophily). 
This isn't a guide to making more diverse friends, but it's something we should all be doing.

The moderator is likely going to have to reach outside of their immediate group and leverage existing resources to find 
experts who are different from them. This is absolutely a required part of your work as a panelist. Fortunately, there are
a lot of amazing resources for this. Ask around, find lists online, reach out to organizers in the community. I believe that 
if you make a heartfelt effort to find diverse panelists, and make it known to the world that you're seeking help in finding
an amazing diverse panel, that the world will point you to the appropriate resources. There's [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariyayao/2017/05/18/meet-20-incredible-women-advancing-a-i-research/#d6615a626f9c) articles
